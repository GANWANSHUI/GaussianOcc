## 📝 Introduction

We introduce GaussianOcc, a systematic method that investigates the two usages of Gaussian splatting for fully self-supervised and efficient 3D occupancy estimation in surround views. First, traditional methods for self-supervised 3D occupancy estimation still require ground truth 6D poses from sensors during training. To address this limitation, we propose Gaussian Splatting for Projection (GSP) module to provide accurate scale information for fully self-supervised training from adjacent view projection. Additionally, existing methods rely on volume rendering for final 3D voxel representation learning using 2D signals (depth maps, semantic maps), which is both time-consuming and less effective. We propose Gaussian Splatting from Voxel space (GSV) to leverage the fast rendering properties of Gaussian splatting. As a result, the proposed GaussianOcc method enables fully self-supervised (no ground truth pose) 3D occupancy estimation in competitive performance with low computational cost (2.7 times faster in training and 5 times faster in rendering).

## 🔧 Installation

Clone this repo and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/GANWANSHUI/GaussianOcc.git
cd GaussianOcc
conda create -n gsocc python=3.8
conda activate gsocc
conda install pytorch==1.9.1 torchvision==0.10.1 cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch -c conda-forge
pip install -r requirements.txt

cd submodule/diff-gaussian-rasterization-confidence
pip install .

cd submodule/diff-gaussian-rasterization-confidence-semantic
pip install .
```

Our code is tested with Python 3.8, PyTorch 1.9.1 and CUDA 11.3 and can be adapted to other versions of PyTorch and CUDA with minor modifications.

You can add the softlink if you already had the related dataset, such as:

```bash
ln -s  path_to_nuscenes GaussianOcc/data

ln -s  path_to_ddad GaussianOcc/data
```

### nuScenes

1. Download nuScenes V1.0 full dataset data from [nuScenes](https://www.nuscenes.org/nuscenes#download) and link the data folder to `./data/nuscenes/nuscenes/`.
2. Download the ground truth occupancy labels from [Occ3d](https://tsinghua-mars-lab.github.io/Occ3D/) and unzip the `gts.tar.gz` to `./data/nuscenes/gts`. Note that we only use the 3d occupancy labels for validation.
3. Generate the ground truth depth maps for validation:

   ```bash
   python tools/export_gt_depth_nusc.py
   ```
4. Download the generated 2D semantic labels from [semantic_labels](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/d/d964ae46e28e473da255/) and extract the data to `./data/nuscenes/`. We recommend that you use `pigz` to speed up the process.
5. Download the pretrained weights of our model from [Google](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ojxpFjj1bG4s5EiteLsqFnAz7liDhgq7) or [百度云](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1rUvOZeVGS_2uyeDNISyF9w), the password is `778c`, and move them to `./ckpts/`.
6. (Optional) If you want to generate the nuScenes 2D semantic labels by yourself, please refer to the `README.md` in [GroundedSAM_OccNeRF](https://github.com/JunchengYan/GroundedSAM_OccNeRF). The  dataset index pickle file `nuscenes_infos_train.pkl` is from [SurroundOcc](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/d/8dcb547238144d08a0bb/) and should be placed under `./data/nuscenes/`.

### DDAD

* Please download the official [DDAD dataset](https://tri-ml-public.s3.amazonaws.com/github/DDAD/datasets/DDAD.tar) and place them under `data/ddad/raw_data`. You may refer to official [DDAD repository](https://github.com/TRI-ML/DDAD) for more info and instructions.
* Please download [metadata](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/50cb1ea5b1344db8b51c/?dl=1) of DDAD and place these pkl files in `datasets/ddad`.
* We provide annotated self-occlusion masks for each sequences. Please download [masks](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/c654cd272a6a42c885f9/?dl=1) and place them in `data/ddad/mask`.
* Export depth maps for evaluation
* The ddad semantic map generation is similar to nuscenes above

```bash
cd tools
python export_gt_depth_ddad.py val
```

- (Optional) If you want to generate the DDAD 2D semantic labels by yourself, we have provided generation code and script based on [GroundedSAM_OccNeRF](https://github.com/JunchengYan/GroundedSAM_OccNeRF). The running requirement is the same as GroundedSAM_OccNeRF.
  First, please copy  ` tools/groundedsam_generate_sem_nusc.py` and `tools/run_generate_ddad_semantic.sh` to GroundedSAM_OccNeRF folder (make sure the GroundedSAM_OccNeRF folder is under the GaussianOcc main folder, i.e., `GaussianOcc/GroundedSAM_OccNeRF`).
  Second, please create a folder named  `configs` under GroundedSAM_OccNeRF folder, and copy the config file,`GaussianOcc/configs/ddad-generate-2d-semantic.txt` to `GaussianOcc/GroundedSAM_OccNeRF/configs`.
  Then you can generate the DDAD semantic dataset by running  `GaussianOcc/GroundedSAM_OccNeRF/run_generate_ddad_semantic.sh`.

The Final folder structure should be like:

```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Training and Evaluation

<!-- Train GaussianOcc with semantic supervision: -->

```bash
sh run_gs_occ.sh
```

### Visualization

Visualize the semantic occupancy prediction:

```bash
python tools/export_vis_data.py  # You can modify this file to choose scenes you want to visualize. Otherwise, all validation scenes will be visualized.

sh run_vis.sh

python gen_scene_video.py scene_folder_generated_by_the_above_command --sem_only
```
